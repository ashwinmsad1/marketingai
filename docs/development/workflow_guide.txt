- **Iterations**: Continuous improvement and adaptation

### Team Structure
```
Development Team
├── Tech Lead (1)
├── Backend Developers (2-3)
├── Frontend Developers (2)
├── DevOps Engineer (1)
├── QA Engineer (1)
└── Product Manager (1)
```

### Communication Tools
- **Project Management**: Jira/Linear for task tracking
- **Communication**: Slack for team communication
- **Documentation**: Confluence/Notion for knowledge sharing
- **Code Review**: GitHub for code collaboration

---

## 2. GIT WORKFLOW & BRANCHING STRATEGY

### 2.1 Branching Model

#### Main Branches
```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
├── staging (pre-production testing)
└── feature branches (development work)
```

#### Branch Naming Convention
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/creative-studio-ui
feature/meta-api-integration

# Bug fix branches
bugfix/campaign-creation-error
bugfix/image-generation-timeout

# Hotfix branches (for production issues)
hotfix/security-patch-auth
hotfix/payment-processing-fix

# Release branches
release/v1.0.0
release/v1.1.0
```

### 2.2 Workflow Process

#### Feature Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/campaign-optimization

# 2. Work on feature with regular commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add budget optimization algorithm"

# 3. Keep feature branch updated
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/campaign-optimization
git rebase develop

# 4. Push feature branch
git push origin feature/campaign-optimization

# 5. Create Pull Request to develop
# 6. Code review and approval
# 7. Merge to develop after approval
```

#### Release Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/v1.1.0

# 2. Version bump and final testing
# Update version numbers
# Run comprehensive tests
# Fix any release-blocking issues

# 3. Merge to main and develop
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.1.0
git tag v1.1.0

git checkout develop  
git merge release/v1.1.0

# 4. Deploy to production
# 5. Delete release branch
git branch -d release/v1.1.0
```

### 2.3 Commit Message Standards

#### Conventional Commits Format
```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Commit Types
```bash
feat: new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation changes
style: formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
refactor: code change that neither fixes bug nor adds feature
perf: performance improvement
test: adding missing tests
chore: maintain tasks, dependency updates

# Examples
feat(auth): add OAuth integration with Meta
fix(campaign): resolve budget calculation error
docs(api): update endpoint documentation
refactor(db): optimize campaign query performance
test(creative): add unit tests for image generation
```

- **Minimum Reviewers**: 2 approvals required for main changes

#### Review Timeline
- **Initial Review**: Within 24 hours of PR creation
- **Follow-up**: Within 4 hours of updates
- **Approval**: All feedback addressed before merge

#### Feedback Guidelines
```markdown
# Constructive Feedback Examples

## Good Feedback
"Consider using a more descriptive variable name here for better readability"
"This function could benefit from error handling for the API call"
"Great implementation! Minor suggestion: we could extract this logic into a utility function"

## Avoid
"This is wrong"
"Bad code"
"Change this"
```
